Welcome to my first JavaScript project!

**PLEASE NOTE** this project is quite small in scope and size, because it is a fallback project. 

My initial JavaScript project can be found here: 
[KILL TEAM Helper Repo](https://github.com/askavian/quiz)
[KILL TEAM Helper LivePage](https://askavian.github.io/quiz/)

It works! But during development, I used a tutorial that cannot be easily expended with the functionality that I wanted and the final results is lacking in certain features required by Code Institute. 

After careful consideration and input from friends, I decided to reduce the scope and produce a barebone, but fun, Quiz for Warhammer. 

I hope you enjoy it!

## **Planning**

### **Site Owner Goals**

- As a site owner, I want to enhance my JavaScript Skills
- As a site owner, I want to provide my friends with a cool gimmik website for our favorite hobby

### **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to test my knwledge on Warhammer and Games Workshop
- As a user, I want to compare my knowledge of Warhammer with others 

## **Features**

**Warhammer 40.000 Quiz** is a small quiz created in JavaScript with a bit of HTML and CSS for optics, that test your knowledge on Warhammer 40.000 and Games Workshop. 

The Quiz includes four questions as well as a detailed sumary page giving the user the correct answers after the quiz. 

The Quiz loops back to the start for the user to complete it again.

#### **Used Technologies**

- **HTML:** Hyper Text Markup Language
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets
- **JavaScript** JavaScript

#### Design

The Design is completely responsive and should work well on all common devices. The measurements are different for eacht viewport when needed and -when possible- the CSS relies on relative measurements (min and max) and not absolutes (i.e. px)

Aestetics and Design is completely utalitarian and fuctional due to time constraints. It is the JavaScript that counts.

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Manual testing was used during the entire development proccess. 
- Testing was done on multiple Devices and Viewports 
    - 4k Monitor
    - 1080p Monitor
    - IPad Air 4.Gen
    - iPhone 13
- Build in Developer Tools in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome where used for debugging

### Validation and Issues

## **Deployment**

Code Institutes Guidlines for deployments are used and recommended:

1. Open the [repository](https://github.com/askavian/warhammer) and go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Navigate to the **Pages** tab in the left menu.
3. Choose **Deploy from a main** and select the according branch, *main* in my case.
4. Click save. The link to the deployed website can then be found in the [repository](https://github.com/askavian/warhammer) on the right menu under **Environments**.

## Version Control
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used for Version Control.
* There is only a single branch **main** used.

## Development Process and Commands

- Using the template provide by Code Institute as basis [gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).  
- I used VSCode and via GitPod and tried to maintain **meningfull** and regular commits (i.e. features, bugs fixes, etc...). 
- Sometimes commits where commited as **temporary** if the code was too big to push at once.
- Each Git Commit deployes after a short delay directly als to GitHub Pages.
